# LangChain-Driven Predictive Maintenance for Industrial IoT  
*Graduation Project — Kuwait College of Science and Technology*

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a hybrid **AI + IoT** system for predictive maintenance in industrial environments, particularly in the oil and gas sector.  
It integrates **machine learning**, **LangChain ReAct agents**, and **IoT hardware** to predict failures before they occur, optimize maintenance schedules, and enable operator interaction through a chatbot interface.

## 🚨 Problem
In high-risk industrial settings like oil pump stations, equipment failure can cause:
- Costly downtime
- Safety hazards
- Disrupted production

Traditional systems are often **reactive**, relying on:
- Fixed maintenance schedules from equipment manufacturers
- Manual monitoring

---

## 💡 Solution
Our system addresses these gaps by combining:
- **Machine Learning**: Stacked ensemble model for accurate failure prediction
- **LangChain Agents**: Automating decision-making and operator interaction
- **IoT Hardware**: Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi for real-time data collection
- **Databases**: MySQL for structured operational data and Pinecone vector store for semantic search over historical maintenance and sensor data o support AI-driven predictive analytics and contextual queries.

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- Predict equipment failures before they occur
- Dynamically schedule maintenance based on live and forecasted conditions
- Enable natural language interaction with the system via a chatbot
